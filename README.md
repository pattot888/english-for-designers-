## history 

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->
When I was 15 i signed my firs contract in art industry. I was exclusive model for elite models. Threw 3 years I was doing many jobs. Most important for me was for “Slovenska sporitelna”. It’s one of the biggest bank in Slovakia. It was short video with many models and you could saw it in cinemas, television and socials. This happened when I was 17. After this experience, I was impressed by the team that work on that video. It was big budget professional team working like they grow up together. After some time I had to decide where I want to go on university. I choose photography on vskk. I didn’t have any experience in photography and very little portfolio. Remember in that time I was mainly model. I moved to Prague, transferred to another modelling agency. But in here it’s much bigger competition. And I had to shoot more because of university. Thanks god for that because modelling industry it really really toxic. You can’t see that but body shaming it’s real thing in here.. it’s hard for mental health. One day I decide to took my cheap camera on festival. Shoot from crowd and post it on ig. I was soo lucky that on of the biggest Slovak rapper saw my work and liked it. He saw potential in me and invited me to his tour. I finished it with him and it was extremely big head start I’m my carrier. Other do this progress in 3 years, I did it in 3 months. Right after tour I terminated my modelling contract and start to fully focuse on photography.
